# TASK1 DETAILS:-
This Python program allows the user to look up a student's marks from a predefined dictionary of student marks. Here's a detailed breakdown of the program:

Program Breakdown
Dictionary of Student Marks:


students_marks = {
    "Alice": 85,
    "Ram": 92,
    "Shyam": 78,
    "Pranshu": 88,
    "Tiwari": 95
}
A dictionary students_marks is created with student names as keys and their corresponding marks as values. In this case, the dictionary contains five student names and their marks.
The keys are the student names (e.g., "Alice", "Ram", etc.), and the values are their marks (e.g., 85, 92, etc.).
User Input for Student Name:


student_name = input("Enter the student's name: ")
The program prompts the user to input the name of the student whose marks they want to look up.
The input() function reads the name as a string and stores it in the variable student_name.
Checking if the Student Exists in the Dictionary:


Copy
if student_name in students_marks:
    print(f"{student_name}'s marks are: {students_marks[student_name]}")
else:
    print(f"Student '{student_name}' not found in the records.")
The if statement checks whether the entered student name is a key in the students_marks dictionary.
If the student's name is found, the program prints the corresponding marks for that student. The marks are accessed using students_marks[student_name].
If the student's name is not found, the program prints a message saying the student is not found in the records.
The dictionary lookup student_name in students_marks checks if the provided name exists as a key in the dictionary.
Example Walkthrough
Case 1: Student Found in the Dictionary
Input: The user enters Alice.
The program checks if "Alice" exists in the dictionary students_marks.
Since "Alice" is a key in the dictionary with a corresponding value of 85, the program will output:

Alice's marks are: 85
Case 2: Student Not Found in the Dictionary
Input: The user enters John.
The program checks if "John" exists in the dictionary students_marks.
Since "John" is not a key in the dictionary, the program will output:

Student 'John' not found in the records.
Key Concepts Explained
Dictionary in Python:

A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs. In this case, student names (keys) are associated with their marks (values). The dictionary provides an efficient way to store and retrieve data based on a unique key.
The in Operator:

The in operator is used to check if a particular value (in this case, a student's name) exists as a key in the dictionary. It returns True if the key is found and False otherwise.
Input and Output:

The input() function is used to capture user input, and the print() function is used to display the results based on that input.
Example Output
Example 1 (Student Found):
User Input: Alice

Enter the student's name: Alice
Alice's marks are: 85
Example 2 (Student Not Found):
User Input: John


Enter the student's name: John
Student 'John' not found in the records.


# TASK2 DETAILS:-
This Python program demonstrates basic list slicing and manipulation techniques, including extracting a portion of a list, reversing it, and printing the results. Here's a detailed explanation of each part of the program:

Program Breakdown
Creating a List of Numbers:



numbers = list(range(1, 11))
range(1, 11) generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to 10 (the range() function excludes the upper bound, so 11 is not included).
list(range(1, 11)) converts this sequence into a list. The resulting list is:


numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Extracting the First Five Elements:



extracted_elements = numbers[:5]
The slicing operation numbers[:5] extracts the first five elements from the list numbers.
In Python, list slicing works as list[start:end], where start is the index to begin from (inclusive) and end is the index to stop at (exclusive). If start is omitted, it defaults to 0, and if end is omitted, it goes up to the end of the list.
So, numbers[:5] gives the first five elements: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
Reversing the Extracted Elements:



reversed_elements = extracted_elements[::-1]
The slicing operation [::-1] reverses the order of the elements in the list. The : indicates the entire list, and -1 specifies that the list should be iterated over in reverse order.
Therefore, extracted_elements[::-1] reverses the extracted list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to give [5, 4, 3, 2, 1].
Printing the Results:


print("Original list:", numbers)
print("Extracted first five elements:", extracted_elements)
print("Reversed extracted elements:", reversed_elements)
The print() function is used to display the original list numbers, the extracted first five elements extracted_elements, and the reversed extracted elements reversed_elements.
Example Walkthrough
Given the code, let’s walk through an example of what happens when it is executed.

Original List:

The list numbers is created as:

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Extracting the First Five Elements:

Using slicing numbers[:5], the first five elements are extracted:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Reversing the Extracted Elements:

The extracted list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is reversed using slicing [::-1]:
[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Printing the Results: The program will print:

Original list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Extracted first five elements: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Reversed extracted elements: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Key Concepts Explained
List Creation:

The range(1, 11) function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 and ending at 10 (inclusive of 1, exclusive of 11).
The list() function converts that sequence into a list object.
List Slicing:

Slicing is a powerful feature in Python to extract a portion of a list.
The syntax for slicing is list[start:end], where:
start: The index where the slice begins (inclusive).
end: The index where the slice ends (exclusive).
In numbers[:5], it starts from index 0 and extracts elements up to (but not including) index 5.
Reversing a List with Slicing:

The slicing operation [::-1] is used to reverse the list. The -1 indicates that the list should be traversed in reverse order.
Printing Lists:

print() is used to display the content of the lists to the console.
Example Output
If you run this program, the output will be:


Original list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Extracted first five elements: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Reversed extracted elements: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Potential Enhancements
Dynamic Input: Instead of using a fixed range, you could modify the program to allow the user to input the range of numbers. This could make it more flexible.

Error Handling: If the user tries to extract more elements than the list contains, the program could be improved to handle such cases gracefully.

Extracting a Subset Based on User Input: You could also allow the user to specify the start and end indices for extraction, adding more flexibility to the slicing operation.

Conclusion
This program illustrates basic list operations in Python, such as creating a list, slicing to extract a subset, reversing that subset, and printing the results. It’s a good starting point for understanding list manipulation and slicing in Python.
